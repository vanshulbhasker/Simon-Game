# Simon-Game

Rules: 
On each iteration, one of the four colours will blink.
you have to remember what colour it was and then click on the colours in the exact same order.
Eg: on the first iteration, colour 'Red' blinked so you click on colour 'Red'.
On the next iteration if colour 'Yellow' blinked, you will have to click on 'Red' and then 'Yellow', so on and so forth.

How far can you go?
